## What is a VRE?
::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}

On-demand cloud computing resources, pre-configured for various research/analysis needs.

Contrast with supercomputing: focus on ease of use, interactivity, collaboration.

- Google Colab
- Custom solutions (e.g. [Biomolecular Interactions](https://rascar.science.uu.nl/))
- **SURF ResearchCloud**

:::

## SURF Research Cloud
::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}

Features:

- Easy collaboration in and across institutions.
- Special applications, customizable environments, reproducibility.
- Special SANE environments for sensitive data.
- Vendor neutral: deploy on commercial cloud, or bring your own cloud.

## SURF Research Cloud
::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}

General use cases:

- Programming and analysis (e.g. R-Studio, Jupyter, Matlab).
- Field-specific software (e.g. GIS).
- On-demand webservices (e.g. Galaxy, ASReview).
- ...or simply your own desktop or commandline machine in the cloud.

## SURF Research Cloud
::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}

For who is it? Those who...

- need to be able to collaborate or share with others.
- need more compute (CPU/GPU), but don't need access to a supercomputer.
- have non-traditional HPC needs (analysis tools and services).
- process sensitive data.

## SURF Research Cloud
::: {style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em"}

What is it not for?

- highly parallelized computations.
- long-living webservices/hosting.
- long-term storage.

:::

## SURF Research Cloud:
::: {.theme-section}
- ResearchCloud started ~7 years ago
- UU has a "Support & development" contract

...but ResearchCloud is also being actively improved in the context of national and international projects
:::

## SURF Research Cloud: national projects

::: {.theme-section}
- DIGILAB (Naturalis, KNMI, WUR, NFI, WODC, RCE, RIVM, TNO, NLR, Deltares, Marin) 
- JUSTICE Link (NFI, WODC)
- Cardio Resource
- FAIRTOOLS
- SANE, SSHOC-NL, Macroscoop
- Cloud-NES
- FairWorkflows (Galaxy, Nextflow, Snakemake)
:::

## SURF Research Cloud: international

::: {.theme-section}
- GEANT DRE PoC (SE, IE, NO, CH)
- EOSC Entrust (TREs)
- Elixir Compute Platform (workflows)
- PanES3
:::

## EOSC NL Node

## VREs and TREs at UU

::: {.theme-section}

![](images/rdms-website.png){width=60%}

- Intake with engineer (30 minutes)
- Starting budget of 10.000 credits
- &rarr; Onboarding time ~2 days

:::


## How much is 10k credits?

::: {.theme-section-large}

- ~ 350 euro
- ~ 10.000 hours on a single CPU core
- ~ 450 hours on a GPU (e.g. NVIDIA A10)
- ~ 1 TB for little more than 1 year

:::


## More on budgets

::: {.theme-section}

- Small compute application (SURF)
  - 50.000 CPU hours, 5.000 GPU hours and 2 TB storage
  - Simple application form, processing time < 2 weeks
  - 1 submission per person per year
- Large compute application (NWO)
  - Anything more than Small Compute Application
  - Larger application form, processing time ~ 2 months

**No project budget is needed!**

## Discussion & Questions

Topics:

- Sensitive data: usescases for SANE? Training?
- What do you need, and how can we cooperate?
- 'One VRE to rule them all'? (name contest!)
- Feature requests?
