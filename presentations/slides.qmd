## What is VRE? DAWA
::: {.theme-section}
Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.
:::

## SURF Research Cloud

::: {.theme-section}
- Started ~7 years ago
- Portal for creating/deploying VREs on SURFs HPC cloud
- Vendor neutral, deploy on commercial clouds (AWS, Azure, european cloud providers)
- Deploy on you own infrastructure
- Usergroup meeting (Support and Development contract)
:::

## SURF Research Cloud: national projects

::: {.theme-section}
- DIGILAB (Naturalis, KNMI, WUR, NFI, WODC, RCE, RIVM, TNO, NLR, Deltares, Marin) 
- JUSTICE Link (NFI, WODC)
- Cardio Resource
- FAIRTOOLS
- SANE, SSHOC-NL, Macroscoop
- Cloud-NES
- FairWorkflows (Galaxy, Nextflow, Snakemake)
:::

## SURF Research Cloud: international

::: {.theme-section}
- GEANT DRE PoC (SE, IE, NO, CH)
- EOSC Entrust (TREs)
- Elixir Compute Platform (workflows)
- PanES3

## Strengths/weaknesses DAWA

## VREs and TREs at UU

::: {.theme-section}

![](images/rdms-website.png){width=75%}

- Intake with engineer (30 minutes)
- Starting budget of 10.000 credits
- &rarr; Onboarding time ~2 days

:::


## What can you get with 10k credits

::: {.theme-section}

- 10.000 credits ~ 350 euro

- ~ 10.000 hours on a single CPU core
- ~ 450 hours on a GPU (NVIDIA RTX 2080, A10)
- ~ 1 TB for little more than 1 year

:::


## More on budgets

::: {.theme-section}

- Small compute application (SURF)
  - 50.000 CPU hours, 5.000 GPU hours and 2 TB storage
  - Simple application form, processing time < 2 weeks
  - 1 submission per person per year
- Large compute application (NWO)
  - Anything more than Small Compute Application
  - Larger application form, processing time ~ 2 months

**No project budget is needed!**

## UU VRE service

::: {.theme-section}
- Support & Consultancy (Walk in hours)
- Getting Started training (bi-weekly)
- Sane training (upon request)
- HPC Spring School (annual)

## Discussion

Sane training?
What do you need?
How can we cooperate?

One VRE to rule them all?
vs
Specific VREs for specific tasks?

Feature requests?
